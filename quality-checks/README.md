# Quality Checks

The final line of defense for code that ships. A nine-phase pipeline that fuses three sources of truth into one pass: security analysis from `claude-code-security-review`, design rigour from `impeccable`, and industry-specific UI intelligence from `ui-ux-pro-max-skill`.

Run it on a branch before merge. Run it on a block before paste. Run it on a page before launch.

## What it catches

- **Exploitable security vulnerabilities** with concrete attack paths (HIGH/MEDIUM only, confidence ≥ 0.8).
- **AI-slop tells**: gradient text, glassmorphism by default, hero-metric template, identical card grids, side-stripe borders, modal-as-first-thought.
- **Design-system drift**: hard-coded colors, off-scale spacing, missing dark-mode variants, wrong component swapped in.
- **Accessibility blockers**: contrast under 4.5:1, touch targets under 44×44, missing focus indicators, illogical tab order, divs masquerading as buttons.
- **Performance regressions**: layout-property animation, unbounded blur, missing lazy loading, layout shift on load.
- **Brittle interfaces**: text overflow, RTL collapse, empty states that read as bugs, error states with no recovery path.
- **AI-flavor copy**: em dashes, `delve`, `seamless`, `robust`, `elevate`, throat-clearing openers, hollow confidence.
- **Stack-specific anti-patterns**: misuse of shadcn primitives, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, layout in React Native that won't reflow, etc.

## Pipeline at a glance

| Phase | Name | Source | Output |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 0 | Discovery & Context | impeccable + ui-ux-pro-max | Register, stack, design system map, industry classification |
| 1 | Security Lockdown | claude-code-security-review | JSON findings, severity, confidence |
| 2 | Anti-Pattern Audit | impeccable + ui-ux-pro-max | Slop tells, scored 0-4 |
| 3 | Design System Conformance | impeccable + ui-ux-pro-max | Drift list with root-cause class |
| 4 | Accessibility Hardening | impeccable + ui-ux-pro-max | WCAG findings, P0-P3 |
| 5 | Performance Audit | impeccable | Bottlenecks, fix priority |
| 6 | Resilience & Edge Cases | impeccable harden | Overflow, i18n, errors, offline |
| 7 | Editorial & Copy | impeccable STYLE.md | Denylist hits + structural issues |
| 8 | Cross-Stack Verification | ui-ux-pro-max stacks | Framework-correct patterns |
| 9 | Sign-Off | composite | Final score, ship verdict |

Full phase definitions live in [`PIPELINE.md`](./PIPELINE.md). The flat ship-blocking checklist is [`CHECKLIST.md`](./CHECKLIST.md). Scoring and sign-off rules are in [`RUBRIC.md`](./RUBRIC.md).

## How to invoke

Three modes, by intent.

```
/quality-checks                        # all nine phases on current branch
/quality-checks phase=2                # one phase
/quality-checks phase=1,3,4            # multiple phases
/quality-checks target=src/Hero.tsx    # scope to a path
/quality-checks target="<paste>"       # vet raw HTML
```

The slash command lives at [`commands/quality-checks.md`](./commands/quality-checks.md). Copy it to `.claude/commands/` to make it user-invokable in Claude Code.

## What you get

1. **Verdict band**. Excellent / Good / Acceptable / Poor / Critical, plus pass-or-fail on Security.
2. **Composite score**. Five dimensions /20 + P0-P3 issue counts + Security severity census.
3. **Top issues, prioritized**. P0 first, with file, line, category, impact, fix.
4. **Drift map**. Every deviation from the design system, classed as missing-token / one-off / conceptual.
5. **Recommended commands**. The next `impeccable` sub-command(s) to run, in order, to close the gaps.

When the verdict is Excellent and Security passes, the branch is ready to merge. Anything below Good ships only with a documented exception.

## What you can paste in

[`BLOCKS.md`](./BLOCKS.md) is a small library of pre-verified UI primitives that already pass every phase: header, hero (no metric template), feature section (no identical-card grid), card (no nested, no side stripe), button (sharp and considered), form, footer, empty state, loading state, error state.

## Source repos

- `claude-code-security-review` — three-phase security analysis with false-positive filtering.
- `impeccable` — 23-command design skill with shared design laws, registers, anti-pattern catalog, editorial denylist.
- `ui-ux-pro-max-skill` — 161 reasoning rules, 67 styles, 161 palettes, 57 font pairings, 99 UX guidelines, 15 stack guides.

## Conflict resolution

| Topic | Sources | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Color tokens | impeccable says OKLCH only; ui-ux-pro-max ships hex palettes | OKLCH for new code. Hex only when the palette is fixed by brand or by a third-party design system. |
| Card style | impeccable warns against identical card grids; ui-ux-pro-max recommends bento and card layouts | Bento grids and varied card sizes are fine. Identical sized + identical shaped cards repeated more than four times is the anti-pattern. |
| Dark mode | impeccable says light-by-default for editorial; ui-ux-pro-max lists Dark Mode (OLED) as a style | Light by default for marketing and editorial. Dark mode is a register-correct choice for product surfaces (dashboards, IDEs, monitoring) when the scene sentence forces it. |
| Animation | both ship guidance | `ease-out-quart` / `quint` / `expo`. No bounce, no elastic. Never animate layout properties. Always honour `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| Em dash | impeccable bans them in copy | Banned in user-facing prose. Permitted in code comments and inline diagnostics. |
