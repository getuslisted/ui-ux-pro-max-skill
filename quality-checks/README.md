# Quality Checks v1.1

The final line of defense for code that ships. A nine-phase pipeline composing security analysis (`claude-code-security-review`), design rigour (`impeccable`), and this repo's industry UI intelligence into one pass.

**v1.1 makes the pipeline actually executable.** The deterministic subset runs as a shell script in CI; the subjective subset runs as a Claude Code slash command. Tests are bundled. The rubric double-count from v1.0 is fixed.

## How to use it

### 1. Deterministic gate (CI-friendly)

```bash
quality-checks/scripts/check.sh
```

Exit 0: pass. Exit 1: P0 or P1 finding. 11 rules covered:

| ID | Rule | Severity |
|----|------|----------|
| qc-001 | Side-stripe border > 1px | P1 |
| qc-002 | Gradient text | P1 |
| qc-007 | Pure `#000` / `#fff` | P2 |
| qc-009 | Layout-property animation | P1 |
| qc-042 | `outline: none` directive | P0 |
| qc-043 | `<div onClick>` | P0 |
| qc-070 | Em dash in user copy | P1 |
| qc-071 | Banned diction | P1 |
| qc-072 | Throat-clearing openers | P2 |
| qc-080 | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` | P0 |
| qc-081 | `v-html`, Svelte `{@html}` | P0 |

Self-test:

```bash
quality-checks/tests/run-tests.sh
# 13 passed, 0 failed
```

### 2. Slash command (LLM judgment)

```
/quality-checks
```

Runs the nine-phase pipeline. Pre-flight runs the deterministic gate; subjective phases (security judgment, design critique, a11y heuristics, resilience review) follow.

## v1.1 changes

- **Deterministic gate**: `scripts/check.sh`, 11 rules, 13 fixtures, self-tested.
- **CI integration**: `.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml`.
- **Rubric fix**: Theming → folded into Design System; Resilience promoted to 5th dimension.
- **Graceful degradation**: `PRODUCT.md` no longer hard-gates.
- **Phase 1 composes** with `/security-review`.
- **Phase 0 industry classification** can invoke this repo's `search.py` when present.
- **Removed `target=<paste>`**.
- **Bundled manifest**.
